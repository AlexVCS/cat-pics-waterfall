# Cat Pics

This repo accompanies an article I wrote titled, ["CSS Masonry Catness"]().

To view this project on your machine as intended you'll need the Safari Technology Preview, or to make the feature flag layout.css.grid-template-masonry-value.enabled true in Firefox.

To access the feature flags in Firefox, type about:config in your address bar. Hit enter and you can search grid or the string mentioned above. Toggle it to true and you're good to go!

Please have a look at [the article]() that goes deeper into the what and how to make a version of this yourself!
